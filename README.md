# titanic-passengers-logistic-regression
Logistic Regression:
In this checkpoint, we are going to work again on the Titanic data set, but this time we will use logistic regression to predict if a passenger will survive or not. 

1. Apply logistic regression. 

2. Use a confusion matrix to validate your model. 

3. Another validation matrix for classification is ROC / AUC, do your research on them explain them, and apply them in our case.
